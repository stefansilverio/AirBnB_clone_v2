# HBNB

This is the console /command interpreter for the Holberton Airbnb clone project. The console can be used to store objects in and retrieve objects from a JSON.

## Storage method:
File storage: uses a custom class `FileStorage` which saves all objects into a file `file.json`
Database storage: uses a custom class `DBStorage` which saves all objects into a database

## How to choose which storage method to use:
To use file storage, simply execute the console file like so: `./console.py`.

To use database storage, use the following environment variables:

* `HBNB_ENV`: running environment. It can be “dev” or “test” for the moment (“production” soon!)
* `HBNB_MYSQL_USER`: the username of your MySQL
* `HBNB_MYSQL_PWD`: the password of your MySQL
* `HBNB_MYSQL_HOST`: the hostname of your MySQL
* `HBNB_MYSQL_DB`: the database name of your MySQL
* `HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE`: the type of storage used. It can be “file” (using FileStorage) or db (using DBStorage)

Example of how to use the console with database storage:

```
$ HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_dev HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_dev_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_dev_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db ./console.py
```

## Supported classes:

To start, navigate to the project folder and enter `./console.py` in the shell.
